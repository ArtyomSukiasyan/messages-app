# Messages app description

## Description

A simple application for exchanging messages between client and server. Created messages are stored in the server memory. Memory capacity is limited to 9 messages. When the limit is reached, new messages replace old ones. WebSocket notifications are sent about added or deleted messages from memory.

UI displays the current list of messages and provides input for
creating new messages.
